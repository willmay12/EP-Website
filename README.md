    	<h1>The Battle Of Waterloo</h1>
    	<p>The battle of waterloo took place on june 18th 1815</p>
    	<h3>Wellington</h3>

    	<h3>Napoleon</h3>

    <div class="boxed">
      <p>Wellington famously called his troops 'the scum of the earth' and thought the British army was terrible; however the Duke would never put his men at any unnecessary risk and valued all of their lives.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="boxed">
      <p>The dish, Beef wellington, is not named after the duke. They were originally made of leather rather than their current plastic make; however they had been already made by Amazonian Indians centuries before they were made for the Duke.</p>

    <div class="boxed">
      <p>Wellington never lost a battle throughout his military career, becoming a master of defence after the Peninsular war against Portugal; he would rather retreat than suffer massive casualties seeming to go by the mantra of 'live to fight another day'.</p>
